## Data Collection
Collecting the data by running the provided python notebook, "simple-twitter-to-db-streamer" is easily run on a local machine. 

## Data Analytics
Due to the high volume of tweets, to effectively run functions and data anaylsis on the data, cloud computing through a cloudlab project is reccomended. In order to do this you need a cloudlab account and the ability to set up your your own docker-spark-cluster. 

In order to set up a docker-spark-cluster, you will need to fork this repository: https://github.com/eflaten0817/docker-spark-cluster
